### Using WHERE with numbers

---

```sql
-- Select film_ids and imdb_score with an imdb_score over 7.0
SELECT film_id,imdb_score
FROM reviews
WHERE imdb_score > 7.0

-- Select film_ids and facebook_likes for ten records with less than 1000 likes
SELECT film_id,facebook_likes
FROM reviews
WHERE facebook_likes < 1000
limit 10;

-- Count the records with at least 100,000 votes
SELECT COUNT(*) as films_over_100k_votes
FROM reviews
WHERE num_votes >= 100000
```

### Using WHERE with text

---

```sql
-- Count the Spanish-language films
SELECT count(language) as count_spanish
FROM films
WHERE language = 'Spanish'
```

### Using AND

---

```sql
-- Select the title and release_year for all German-language films released before 2000
SELECT title,release_year
FROM films
WHERE language = 'German' and release_year < 2000;

-- Update the query to see all German-language films released after 2000
SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 2000
	AND language = 'German';

-- Select all records for German-language films released after 2000 and before 2010
SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE language = 'German' and release_year > 2000 and release_year < 2010;
```

### Using OR

---

```sql
-- Find the title and year of films from the 1990 or 1999
SELECT title,release_year
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1990 or release_year = 1999

SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1990 OR release_year = 1999)
-- Add a filter to see only English or Spanish-language films
	and (language = 'English' or language = 'Spanish');

SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1990 OR release_year = 1999)
	AND (language = 'English' OR language = 'Spanish')
-- Filter films with more than $2,000,000 gross
	AND gross >= 2000000;
```

### Using BETWEEN

---

```sql
-- Select the title and release_year for films released between 1990 and 2000
select title,release_year
from films
where release_year between 1990 and 2000

SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
-- Narrow down your query to films with budgets > $100 million
	and budget > 100000000;

SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
	AND budget > 100000000
-- Restrict the query to only Spanish-language films
	AND language = 'Spanish';

SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
	AND budget > 100000000
-- Amend the query to include Spanish or French-language films
	AND (language ='Spanish' or language = 'French');
```

### LIKE and NOT LIKE

---

```sql
-- Select the names that start with B
select name from people
where name like 'B%'

SELECT name
FROM people
-- Select the names that have r as the second letter
where name like '_r%'

SELECT name
FROM people
-- Select names that don't start with A
where name not like 'A%'
```

### WHERE IN

---

```sql
-- Find the title and release_year for all films over two hours in length released in 1990 and 2000
select title,release_year
from films
where release_year in (1990,2000) and duration >120

-- Find the title and language of all films in English, Spanish, and French
select title,language
from films
where language in ('English','Spanish','French')

-- Find the title, certification, and language all films certified NC-17 or R that are in English, Italian, or Greek
select title,certification,language
from films
where certification in ('NC-17','R') and language in ('English','Italian','Greek')
```

### Combining filtering and selecting

---

```sql
-- Count the unique titles
SELECT count(distinct title) AS nineties_english_films_for_teens
FROM films
-- Filter to release_years to between 1990 and 1999
WHERE release_year between 1990 and 1999
-- Filter to English-language films
	and language ='English'
-- Narrow it down to G, PG, and PG-13 certifications
	and certification in ('G','PG','PG-13');
```

### Practice with NULLs

---

```sql
-- List all film titles with missing budgets
select title as no_budget_info
from films
where budget is null

-- Count the number of films we have language data for
select count(*) as count_language_known
from films
where language is not null
```
