### A basic pivot
_____________________________
```sql
-- Create the correct extension to enable CROSSTAB
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
  SELECT
    Gender, Year, Country
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Year IN (2008, 2012)
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Event = 'Pole Vault'
  ORDER By Gender ASC, Year ASC;
-- Fill in the correct column names for the pivoted table
$$) AS ct (Gender VARCHAR,
           "2008" VARCHAR,
           "2012" VARCHAR)

ORDER BY Gender ASC;
```

### Pivoting with ranking
_____________________________
```sql
-- Count the gold medals per country and year
SELECT
  Country,
  Year,
  count(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Country IN ('FRA', 'GBR', 'GER')
  AND Year IN (2004, 2008, 2012)
  AND Medal = 'Gold'
GROUP BY Country, Year
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC

WITH Country_Awards AS (
  SELECT
    Country,
    Year,
    COUNT(*) AS Awards
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('FRA', 'GBR', 'GER')
    AND Year IN (2004, 2008, 2012)
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
  GROUP BY Country, Year)

SELECT
  -- Select Country and Year
  Country,
  Year,
  -- Rank by gold medals earned per year
  rank() over(partition by Year order by Awards):: INTEGER AS rank
FROM Country_Awards
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
  WITH Country_Awards AS (
    SELECT
      Country,
      Year,
      COUNT(*) AS Awards
    FROM Summer_Medals
    WHERE
      Country IN ('FRA', 'GBR', 'GER')
      AND Year IN (2004, 2008, 2012)
      AND Medal = 'Gold'
    GROUP BY Country, Year)

  SELECT
    Country,
    Year,
    RANK() OVER
      (PARTITION BY Year
       ORDER BY Awards DESC) :: INTEGER AS rank
  FROM Country_Awards
  ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;
-- Fill in the correct column names for the pivoted table
$$) AS ct (Country VARCHAR,
           "2004" INTEGER,
           "2008" INTEGER,
           "2012" INTEGER)

Order by Country ASC;
```

### Country-level subtotals
_____________________________
```sql
-- Count the gold medals per country and gender
SELECT
  Country,
  Gender,
  COUNT(*) AS Gold_Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2004
  AND Medal = 'Gold'
  AND Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'SWE')
-- Generate Country-level subtotals
GROUP BY Country, ROLLUP(Gender)
ORDER BY Country ASC, Gender ASC;
```

### All group-level subtotals
_____________________________
```sql
-- Count the medals per gender and medal type
SELECT
  Gender,
  Medal,
  count(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2012
  AND Country = 'RUS'
-- Get all possible group-level subtotals
GROUP BY CUBE(Gender,Medal) 
ORDER BY Gender ASC, Medal ASC;
```

### Cleaning up results
_____________________________
```sql
SELECT
  -- Replace the nulls in the columns with meaningful text
  COALESCE(Country, 'All countries') AS Country,
  COALESCE(Gender, 'All genders') AS Gender,
  COUNT(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2004
  AND Medal = 'Gold'
  AND Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'SWE')
GROUP BY ROLLUP(Country, Gender)
ORDER BY Country ASC, Gender ASC;
```

### Summarizing results
_____________________________
```sql
WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Country,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE Year = 2000
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
  GROUP BY Country)

  SELECT
    Country,
    -- Rank countries by the medals awarded
    rank()over(order by Medals desc) AS Rank
  FROM Country_Medals
  ORDER BY Rank ASC;

WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Country,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE Year = 2000
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
  GROUP BY Country),

  Country_Ranks AS (
  SELECT
    Country,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Rank
  FROM Country_Medals
  ORDER BY Rank ASC)

-- Compress the countries column
SELECT string_agg(Country, ', ')
FROM Country_Ranks
-- Select only the top three ranks
WHERE Rank <= 3;
```
