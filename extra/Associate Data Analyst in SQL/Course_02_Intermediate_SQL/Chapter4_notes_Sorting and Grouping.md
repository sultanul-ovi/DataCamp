### Sorting single fields

---

```sql
-- Select name from people and sort alphabetically
select name from people
order by name

-- Select the title and duration from longest to shortest film
select title,duration from films
order by duration desc
```

### Sorting multiple fields

---

```sql
-- Select the release year, duration, and title sorted by release year and duration
select release_year,duration,title from films
order by release_year,duration

-- Select the certification, release year, and title sorted by certification and release year
select certification,release_year,title from films
order by certification,release_year desc
```

### GROUP BY single fields

---

```sql
-- Find the release_year and film_count of each year
select release_year,count(*) as film_count
from films
group by release_year

-- Find the release_year and average duration of films for each year
select release_year,avg(duration) as avg_duration from films
group by release_year
```

### GROUP BY multiple fields

---

```sql
-- Find the release_year, country, and max_budget, then group and order by release_year and country
select release_year,country,max(budget) as max_budget
from films
group by release_year,country
order by release_year,country
```

### Filter with HAVING

---

```sql
-- Select the country and distinct count of certification as certification_count
select country,count(distinct(certification)) as certification_count from films
-- Group by country
group by country
-- Filter results to countries with more than 10 different certifications
having count(distinct(certification)) > 10;
```

### HAVING and sorting

---

```sql
-- Select the country and average_budget from films
select country, round(avg(budget),2) as average_budget from films
-- Group by country
group by country
-- Filter to countries with an average_budget of more than one billion
having avg(budget) > 1000000000
-- Order by descending order of the aggregated budget
order by average_budget desc
```

### All together now

---

```sql
-- Select the release_year for films released after 1990 grouped by year
select release_year from films
group by release_year
having release_year > 1990

-- Modify the query to also list the average budget and average gross
SELECT release_year, avg(budget) as avg_budget, avg(gross) as avg_gross
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1990
GROUP BY release_year;

SELECT release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1990
GROUP BY release_year
-- Modify the query to see only years with an avg_budget of more than 60 million
having avg(budget) > 60000000;

SELECT release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1990
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING AVG(budget) > 60000000
-- Order the results from highest to lowest average gross and limit to one
ORDER BY AVG(gross) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
