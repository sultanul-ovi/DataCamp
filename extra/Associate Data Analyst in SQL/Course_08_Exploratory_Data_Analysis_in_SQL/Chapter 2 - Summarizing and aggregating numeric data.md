### Division
————————————————————————————————
```sql
-- Select average revenue per employee by sector
SELECT sector, 
       avg(revenues/employees::numeric) AS avg_rev_employee
  FROM fortune500
 GROUP BY sector
 -- Use the column alias to order the results
 ORDER BY avg_rev_employee;
```

### Explore with division
————————————————————————————————
```sql
-- Divide unanswered_count by question_count
SELECT unanswered_count/question_count::numeric AS computed_pct, 
       -- What are you comparing the above quantity to?
       unanswered_pct
  FROM stackoverflow
 -- Select rows where question_count is not 0
 WHERE question_count != 0
 limit 10;
 ```

### Summarize numeric columns
————————————————————————————————
```sql

### Summarize group statistics
————————————————————————————————
```sql
-- Compute standard deviation of maximum values
SELECT stddev(maxval),
	   -- min
       min(maxval),
       -- max
       max(maxval),

       avg(maxval)
  -- Subquery to compute max of question_count by tag
  FROM (SELECT max(question_count) AS maxval
          FROM stackoverflow
         -- Compute max by...
         GROUP BY tag) AS max_results; -- alias for subquery
```

### Truncate
————————————————————————————————
```sql
-- Truncate employees
SELECT trunc(employees, -5) AS employee_bin,
       -- Count number of companies with each truncated value
       count(*)
  FROM fortune500
 -- Use alias to group

       count(*)
  FROM fortune500
 -- Limit to which companies?
 WHERE employees < 100000
 -- Use alias to group
 GROUP BY employee_bin
 -- Use alias to order
 ORDER BY employee_bin;
```

### Generate series
————————————————————————————————
```sql
-- Select the min and max of question_count
SELECT min(question_count), 
       max(question_count)
  -- From what table?
  FROM stackoverflow
 -- For tag dropbox
 where tag = 'dropbox';

-- Create lower and upper bounds of bins
SELECT generate_series(2200, 3050, 50) AS lower,
       generate_series(2250, 3100, 50) AS upper;

-- Bins created in Step 2
WITH bins AS (
      SELECT generate_series(2200, 3050, 50) AS lower,
             generate_series(2250, 3100, 50) AS upper),
     -- Subset stackoverflow to just tag dropbox (Step 1)
     dropbox AS (
      SELECT question_count 
        FROM stackoverflow
       WHERE tag='dropbox') 
-- Select columns for result
-- What column are you counting to summarize?
SELECT lower, upper, count(question_count) 
  FROM bins  -- Created above
       -- Join to dropbox (created above), 
       -- keeping all rows from the bins table in the join
       left JOIN dropbox
       -- Compare question_count to lower and upper
         ON question_count >= lower 
        AND question_count < upper
 -- Group by lower and upper to count values in each bin
 GROUP BY lower, upper
 -- Order by lower to put bins in order
 ORDER BY lower;
```

### Correlation
————————————————————————————————
```sql
-- Correlation between revenues and profit
SELECT corr(revenues,profits) AS rev_profits,
	   -- Correlation between revenues and assets
       corr(revenues,assets) AS rev_assets,
       -- Correlation between revenues and equity
       corr(revenues,equity) AS rev_equity 
  FROM fortune500;
  ```

### Mean and Median
————————————————————————————————
```sql
-- What groups are you computing statistics by?
SELECT sector,
       -- Select the mean of assets with the avg function
       avg(assets) AS mean,
       -- Select the median
       percentile_disc(.5) within group (order by assets) AS median
  FROM fortune500
 -- Computing statistics for each what?
 GROUP BY sector
 -- Order results by a value of interest
 ORDER BY mean;
```

### Create a temp table
————————————————————————————————
```sql
-- To clear table if it already exists;
-- fill in name of temp table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS profit80;

-- Create the temporary table
create temp table profit80 AS 
  -- Select the two columns you need; alias as needed
  SELECT sector, 
         percentile_disc(.8) within group (order by profits) AS pct80
    -- What table are you getting the data from?
    from fortune500
   -- What do you need to group by?
   group by sector;
   
-- See what you created: select all columns and rows 
-- from the table you created
SELECT * 
  FROM profit80;

-- Code from previous step
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS profit80;

CREATE TEMP TABLE profit80 AS
  SELECT sector, 
         percentile_disc(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY profits) AS pct80
    FROM fortune500 
   GROUP BY sector;

-- Select columns, aliasing as needed
SELECT title, fortune500.sector, 
       profits, profits/pct80 AS ratio
-- What tables do you need to join?  
  FROM fortune500 
       LEFT JOIN profit80
-- How are the tables joined?
       ON fortune500.sector=profit80.sector
-- What rows do you want to select?
 WHERE profits > pct80;
  ```

### Create a temp table to simplify a query
————————————————————————————————
```sql
-- To clear table if it already exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS startdates;

-- Create temp table syntax
CREATE temp table startdates AS
-- Compute the minimum date for each what?
SELECT tag,
       min(date) AS mindate
  FROM stackoverflow
 -- What do you need to compute the min date for each tag?
 group by tag;
 
 -- Look at the table you created
 SELECT * 
   FROM startdates;

-- To clear table if it already exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS startdates;

CREATE TEMP TABLE startdates AS
SELECT tag, min(date) AS mindate
  FROM stackoverflow
 GROUP BY tag;
 
-- Select tag (Remember the table name!) and mindate
SELECT startdates.tag, 
       startdates.mindate, 
       -- Select question count on the min and max days
	   so_min.question_count AS min_date_question_count,
       so_max.question_count AS max_date_question_count,
       -- Compute the change in question_count (max- min)
       so_max.question_count - so_min.question_count AS change
  FROM startdates
       -- Join startdates to stackoverflow with alias so_min
       INNER JOIN stackoverflow AS so_min
          -- What needs to match between tables?
          ON startdates.tag = so_min.tag
         AND startdates.mindate = so_min.date
       -- Join to stackoverflow again with alias so_max
       INNER JOIN stackoverflow AS so_max
       	  -- Again, what needs to match between tables?
          ON startdates.tag = so_max.tag
         AND so_max.date = '2018-09-25';
   ```

### Insert into a temp table
————————————————————————————————
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS correlations;

-- Create temp table 
create temp table correlations AS
-- Select each correlation
SELECT 'profits'::varchar AS measure,
       -- Compute correlations

-- Repeat the above, but for revenues_change
INSERT INTO correlations

       corr(revenues_change, profits_change) AS profits_change,
       corr(revenues_change, revenues_change) AS revenues_change

-- Select each column, rounding the correlations
SELECT measure, 
       round(profits::numeric,2) AS profits,
       round(profits_change::numeric,2) AS profits_change,
       round(revenues_change::numeric,2) AS revenues_change
  FROM correlations;
