##  Assignment 

If you have a look at your colorful plot, it's clear that people live longer in countries with a higher GDP per capita. No high income countries have really short life expectancy, and no low income countries have very long life expectancy. Still, there is a huge difference in life expectancy between countries on the same income level. Most people live in middle income countries where difference in lifespan is huge between countries; depending on how income is distributed and how it is used.

What can you say about the plot?

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; import importlib; importlib.reload(plt)
plt.clf()
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('https://assets.datacamp.com/course/intermediate_python/gapminder.csv', index_col = 0)
gdp_cap = list(df.gdp_cap)
life_exp = list(df.life_exp)
pop = list(df['population']/1e6)
cont = list(df.cont)
lut = {
    'Asia':'red',
    'Europe':'green',
    'Africa':'blue',
    'Americas':'yellow',
    'Oceania':'black'
}
col = [lut[x] for x in cont]
plt.scatter(x = gdp_cap, y = life_exp, s = np.array(pop) * 2, c = col, alpha = 0.8)
plt.xscale('log') 
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita [in USD]')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy [in years]')
plt.title('World Development in 2007')
plt.xticks([1000,10000,100000], ['1k','10k','100k'])
plt.text(800, 70, 'India')
plt.text(5700, 80, 'China')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```



##  Answers 
1. The countries in blue, corresponding to Africa, have both low life expectancy and a low GDP per capita.
1. There is a negative correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy.
1. China has both a lower GDP per capita and lower life expectancy compared to India.


##  Hints 

- There is a clearly positive correlation, so you can rule out the second option.



##  Solution 

No solution was found.
