#  CSV to DataFrame (2)

```
Exercise ID 15617
```

##  Assignment 

Your [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call to import the CSV data didn't generate an error, but the output is not entirely what we wanted. The row labels were imported as another column without a name.

Remember `index_col`, an argument of [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html), that you can use to specify which column in the CSV file should be used as a row label? Well, that's exactly what you need here!

Python code that solves the previous exercise is already included; can you make the appropriate changes to fix the data import?

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

- Run the code with **Run Code** and assert that the first column should actually be used as row labels.
- Specify the `index_col` argument inside [`pd.read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html): set it to `0`, so that the first column is used as row labels.
- Has the printout of `cars` improved now?



```
# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Fix import by including index_col
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')

# Print out cars
print(cars)
```

##  Hints 

- Use `pd.read_csv(cars, index_col = ...)`; can you fill in the `...`?



##  Solution 

```
# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Fix import by including index_col
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out cars
print(cars)
```
