#  Square Brackets (1)

```
Exercise ID 15619
```

##  Assignment 

In the video, you saw that you can index and select Pandas DataFrames in many different ways. The simplest, but not the most powerful way, is to use square brackets.

In the sample code, the same cars data is imported from a CSV files as a Pandas DataFrame. To select only the `cars_per_cap` column from `cars`, you can use:

```
cars['cars_per_cap']
cars[['cars_per_cap']]

```

The single bracket version gives a Pandas Series, the double bracket version gives a Pandas DataFrame.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

- Use single square brackets to print out the `country` column of `cars` as a Pandas Series.
- Use double square brackets to print out the `country` column of `cars` as a Pandas DataFrame.
- Use double square brackets to print out a DataFrame with both the `country` and `drives_right` columns of `cars`, in this order.



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out country column as Pandas Series


# Print out country column as Pandas DataFrame


# Print out DataFrame with country and drives_right columns

```

##  Hints 

- For instruction 1, use `['country']`.
- For instruction 2, use `[['country']]`.
- For instruction 3, use `[['country', 'drives_right']]`.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out country column as Pandas Series
print(cars['country'])

# Print out country column as Pandas DataFrame
print(cars[['country']])

# Print out DataFrame with country and drives_right columns
print(cars[['country', 'drives_right']])
```
