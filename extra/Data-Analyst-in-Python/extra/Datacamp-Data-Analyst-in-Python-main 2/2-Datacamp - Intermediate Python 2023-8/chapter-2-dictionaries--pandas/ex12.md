#  Square Brackets (2)

```
Exercise ID 15620
```

##  Assignment 

Square brackets can do more than just selecting columns. You can also use them to get rows, or observations, from a DataFrame. The following call selects the first five rows from the `cars` DataFrame:

```
cars[0:5]

```

The result is another DataFrame containing only the rows you specified.

Pay attention: You can only select rows using square brackets if you specify a slice, like `0:4`. Also, you're using the integer indexes of the rows here, not the row labels!

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

- Select the first 3 observations from `cars` and print them out.
- Select the fourth, fifth and sixth observation, corresponding to row indexes 3, 4 and 5, and print them out.



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out first 3 observations


# Print out fourth, fifth and sixth observation

```

##  Hints 

- For the first instruction, use `[0:3]`. Don't forget to wrap your code in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) statement.
- For the second instruction, use `[3:6]`. Don't forget to wrap your code in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) statement.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out first 3 observations
print(cars[0:3])

# Print out fourth, fifth and sixth observation
print(cars[3:6])
```
