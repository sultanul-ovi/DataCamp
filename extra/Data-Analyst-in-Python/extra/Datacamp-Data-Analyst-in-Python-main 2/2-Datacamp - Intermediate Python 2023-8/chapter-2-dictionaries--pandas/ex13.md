#  loc and iloc (1)

```
Exercise ID 15621
```

##  Assignment 

With [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) and [`iloc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) you can do practically any data selection operation on DataFrames you can think of. [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) is label-based, which means that you have to specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels. [`iloc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) is integer index based, so you have to specify rows and columns by their integer index like you did in the previous exercise.

Try out the following commands in the IPython Shell to experiment with [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) and [`iloc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) to select observations. Each pair of commands here gives the same result.

```
cars.loc['RU']
cars.iloc[4]

cars.loc[['RU']]
cars.iloc[[4]]

cars.loc[['RU', 'AUS']]
cars.iloc[[4, 1]]

```

As before, code is included that imports the cars data as a Pandas DataFrame.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)
```



##  Instructions 

- Use [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) or [`iloc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) to select the observation corresponding to Japan as a Series. The label of this row is `JPN`, the index is `2`. Make sure to print the resulting Series.
- Use [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) or [`iloc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) to select the observations for Australia and Egypt as a DataFrame. You can find out about the labels/indexes of these rows by inspecting `cars` in the IPython Shell. Make sure to print the resulting DataFrame.



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out observation for Japan


# Print out observations for Australia and Egypt

```

##  Hints 

- For the first instruction, use `.loc['JPN']` or `.iloc[2]`. Don't forget to wrap your code in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) statement.
- For the second instruction, use `.loc[['AUS', 'EG']]` or `.iloc[1,6]`. Don't forget to wrap your code in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) statement.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out observation for Japan
print(cars.iloc[2])

# Print out observations for Australia and Egypt
print(cars.loc[['AUS', 'EG']])
```
