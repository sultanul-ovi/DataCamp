#  loc and iloc (3)

```
Exercise ID 15623
```

##  Assignment 

It's also possible to select only columns with [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) and [`iloc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing). In both cases, you simply put a slice going from beginning to end in front of the comma:

```
cars.loc[:, 'country']
cars.iloc[:, 1]

cars.loc[:, ['country','drives_right']]
cars.iloc[:, [1, 2]]

```

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)
```



##  Instructions 

- Print out the `drives_right` column as a Series using [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) or [`iloc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing).
- Print out the `drives_right` column as a DataFrame using [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) or [`iloc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing).
- Print out both the `cars_per_cap` and `drives_right` column as a DataFrame using [`loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing) or [`iloc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing).



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out drives_right column as Series


# Print out drives_right column as DataFrame


# Print out cars_per_cap and drives_right as DataFrame


```

##  Hints 

- For the first instruction, use `.loc[:, 'drives_right']` or `.iloc[:, 2]`. Don't forget to wrap your code in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) statement.
- For the second instruction, use `.loc[:, ['drives_right']]` or `.iloc[:, [2]]`. Don't forget to wrap your code in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) statement.
- For the third instruction, use `.loc[:, ['cars_per_cap', 'drives_right']]` or `.iloc[:, [0, 2]]`. Don't forget to wrap your code in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) statement.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out drives_right column as Series
print(cars.iloc[:, 2])

# Print out drives_right column as DataFrame
print(cars.iloc[:, [2]])

# Print out cars_per_cap and drives_right as DataFrame
print(cars.loc[:, ['cars_per_cap', 'drives_right']])
```
