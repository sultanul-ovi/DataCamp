#  Customize further: elif

```
Exercise ID 15666
```

##  Assignment 

It's also possible to have a look around in the bedroom. The sample code contains an `elif` part that checks if `room` equals "bed". In that case, "looking around in the bedroom." is printed out.

It's up to you now! Make a similar addition to the second control structure to further customize the messages for different values of `area`.

##  Instructions 

Add an `elif` to the second control structure such that "medium size, nice!" is printed out if `area` is greater than `10`.



```
# Define variables
room = "bed"
area = 14.0

# if-elif-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
elif room == "bed":
    print("looking around in the bedroom.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-elif-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
else :
    print("pretty small.")
```

##  Hints 

- Use the same syntax as in the first control structure; don't forget the colon! 
- The condition with this `elif` should be `area &gt; 10`.
- Pay attention to punctuation marks and capitalization.



##  Solution 

```
# Define variables
room = "bed"
area = 14.0

# if-elif-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
elif room == "bed":
    print("looking around in the bedroom.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-elif-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
elif area > 10 :
    print("medium size, nice!")
else :
    print("pretty small.")
```
