#  Driving right (1)

```
Exercise ID 15667
```

##  Assignment 

Remember that `cars` dataset, containing the cars per 1000 people (`cars_per_cap`) and whether people drive right (`drives_right`) for different countries (`country`)? The code that imports this data in CSV format into Python as a DataFrame is included in the script.

In the video, you saw a step-by-step approach to filter observations from a DataFrame based on boolean arrays. Let's start simple and try to find all observations in `cars` where `drives_right` is `True`.

`drives_right` is a boolean column, so you'll have to extract it as a Series and then use this boolean Series to select observations from `cars`.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

- Extract the `drives_right` column **as a Pandas Series** and store it as `dr`.
- Use `dr`, a boolean Series, to subset the `cars` DataFrame. Store the resulting selection in `sel`.
- Print `sel`, and assert that `drives_right` is `True` for all observations.



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr


# Use dr to subset cars: sel


# Print sel

```

##  Hints 

- To select the `drives_right` column as a Series, you can use `['drives_right']`
- To use `dr` to subset `cars`, you can use `cars[dr]`. `dr` is a variable this time, so no need for quotes!
- To print out a variable `x`, type `print(x)` on a new line in your script.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr = cars['drives_right']

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel = cars[dr]

# Print sel
print(sel)
```
