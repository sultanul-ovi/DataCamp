#  Driving right (2)

```
Exercise ID 15668
```

##  Assignment 

The code in the previous example worked fine, but you actually unnecessarily created a new variable `dr`. You can achieve the same result without this intermediate variable. Put the code that computes `dr` straight into the square brackets that select observations from `cars`.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

Convert the code to a one-liner that calculates the variable `sel` as before.



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Convert code to a one-liner
dr = cars['drives_right']
sel = cars[dr]

# Print sel
print(sel)
```

##  Hints 

Replace `dr` in `cars[dr]` by `cars['drives_right']` and see what happens.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Convert code to a one-liner
sel = cars[cars['drives_right']]

# Print sel
print(sel)
```
