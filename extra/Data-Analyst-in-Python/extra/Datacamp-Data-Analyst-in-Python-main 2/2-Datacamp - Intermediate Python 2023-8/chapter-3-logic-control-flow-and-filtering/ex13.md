#  Cars per capita (1)

```
Exercise ID 15669
```

##  Assignment 

Let's stick to the `cars` data some more. This time you want to find out which countries have a high **cars per capita** figure. In other words, in which countries do many people have a car, or maybe multiple cars.

Similar to the previous example, you'll want to build up a boolean Series, that you can then use to subset the `cars` DataFrame to select certain observations. If you want to do this in a one-liner, that's perfectly fine!

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

- Select the `cars_per_cap` column from `cars` as a Pandas Series and store it as `cpc`.
- Use `cpc` in combination with a comparison operator and `500`. You want to end up with a boolean Series that's `True` if the corresponding country has a `cars_per_cap` of more than `500` and `False` otherwise. Store this boolean Series as `many_cars`.
- Use `many_cars` to subset `cars`, similar to what you did before. Store the result as `car_maniac`.
- Print out `car_maniac` to see if you got it right.



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Create car_maniac: observations that have a cars_per_cap over 500




# Print car_maniac

```

##  Hints 

- To select the `cars_per_cap` column, you can use `['cars_per_cap']`.
- `cpc &gt; 500` will give you the boolean Series you're looking for.
- `cars[many_cars]` will select the observations where `many_cars` is `True`.
- To print out a variable `x`, type `print(x)` on a new line in your script.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Create car_maniac: observations that have a cars_per_cap over 500
cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
many_cars = cpc > 500
car_maniac = cars[many_cars]

# Print car_maniac
print(car_maniac)
```
