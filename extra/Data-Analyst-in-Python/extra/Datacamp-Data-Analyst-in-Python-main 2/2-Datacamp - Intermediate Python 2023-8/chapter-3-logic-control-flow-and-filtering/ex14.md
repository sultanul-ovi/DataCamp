#  Cars per capita (2)

```
Exercise ID 15670
```

##  Assignment 

Remember about [`np.logical_and()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.logical_and.html), [`np.logical_or()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.logical_or.html) and [`np.logical_not()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.logical_not.html), the NumPy variants of the `and`, `or` and `not` operators? You can also use them on Pandas Series to do more advanced filtering operations.

Take this example that selects the observations that have a `cars_per_cap` between 10 and 80. Try out these lines of code step by step to see what's happening.

```
cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
between = np.logical_and(cpc &gt; 10, cpc &lt; 80)
medium = cars[between]

```

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

- Use the code sample provided to create a DataFrame `medium`, that includes all the observations of `cars` that have a `cars_per_cap` between `100` and `500`.
- Print out `medium`.



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Import numpy, you'll need this
import numpy as np

# Create medium: observations with cars_per_cap between 100 and 500




# Print medium

```

##  Hints 

- You can use the code sample provided and change some numbers and variable names here and there.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Import numpy, you'll need this
import numpy as np

# Create medium: observations with cars_per_cap between 100 and 500
cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
between = np.logical_and(cpc > 100, cpc < 500)
medium = cars[between]

# Print medium
print(medium)
```
