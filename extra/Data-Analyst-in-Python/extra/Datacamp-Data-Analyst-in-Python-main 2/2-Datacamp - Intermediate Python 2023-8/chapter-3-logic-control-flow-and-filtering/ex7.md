##  Assignment 

To experiment with `if` and `else` a bit, have a look at this code sample:

```
area = 10.0
if(area &lt; 9) :
    print("small")
elif(area &lt; 12) :
    print("medium")
else :
    print("large")

```

What will the output be if you run this piece of code in the IPython Shell?

##  Answers 
1. `small`
1. `medium`
1. `large`
1. The syntax is incorrect; this code will produce an error.


##  Hints 

If you're not sure about the result, simply copy the code and paste it in the IPython Shell. What is the output if you hit Enter?
