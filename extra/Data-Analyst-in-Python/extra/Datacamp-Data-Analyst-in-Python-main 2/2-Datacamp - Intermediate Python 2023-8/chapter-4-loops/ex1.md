#  while: warming up

```
Exercise ID 15672
```

##  Assignment 

The while loop is like a repeated if statement. The code is executed over and over again, as long as the condition is `True`. Have another look at its recipe.

```
while condition :
    expression

```

Can you tell how many printouts the following `while` loop will do?

```
x = 1
while x &lt; 4 :
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

```
