#  Loop over DataFrame (1)

```
Exercise ID 15682
```

##  Assignment 

Iterating over a Pandas DataFrame is typically done with the [`iterrows()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.iterrows.html) method. Used in a `for` loop, every observation is iterated over and on every iteration the row label and actual row contents are available:

```
for lab, row in brics.iterrows() :
    ...

```

In this and the following exercises you will be working on the `cars` DataFrame. It contains information on the cars per capita and whether people drive right or left for seven countries in the world.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

Write a `for` loop that iterates over the rows of `cars` and on each iteration perform two [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) calls: one to print out the row label and one to print out all of the rows contents.



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Iterate over rows of cars

```

##  Hints 

Start from the the code example. change the `brics` variable to `cars` and replace `...` with two [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) calls.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Iterate over rows of cars
for lab, row in cars.iterrows() :
    print(lab)
    print(row)
```
