#  Loop over DataFrame (2)

```
Exercise ID 15683
```

##  Assignment 

The row data that's generated by [`iterrows()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iterrows.html) on every run is a Pandas Series. This format is not very convenient to print out. Luckily, you can easily select variables from the Pandas Series using square brackets:

```
for lab, row in brics.iterrows() :
    print(row['country'])

```

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

- Using the iterators `lab` and `row`, adapt the code in the for loop such that the first iteration prints out `"US: 809"`, the second iteration `"AUS: 731"`, and so on. 
<li>The output should be in the form `"country: cars_per_cap"`. Make sure to print out this exact string (with the correct spacing).<ul>
- **You can use `str()` to convert your integer data to a string so that you can print it in conjunction with the country label.**


```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Adapt for loop
for lab, row in cars.iterrows() :
    print(lab)
    print(row)
```

##  Hints 

- You don't have to change anything about `for lab, row in cars.iterrows()`.
- Remove the two printouts and put another one instead. Inside the [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) call you'll need `str(row['cars_per_cap'])` to print the `cars_per_cap` data.



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Adapt for loop
for lab, row in cars.iterrows() :
    print(lab + ": " + str(row['cars_per_cap']))
```
