#  Add column (1)

```
Exercise ID 15684
```

##  Assignment 

In the video, Hugo showed you how to add the length of the country names of the `brics` DataFrame in a new column:

```
for lab, row in brics.iterrows() :
    brics.loc[lab, "name_length"] = len(row["country"])

```

You can do similar things on the `cars` DataFrame.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
f = open('cars.csv', "w")
f.write(""",cars_per_cap,country,drives_right
US,809,United States,True
AUS,731,Australia,False
JPN,588,Japan,False
IN,18,India,False
RU,200,Russia,True
MOR,70,Morocco,True
EG,45,Egypt,True""")
f.close()
```



##  Instructions 

- Use a `for` loop to add a new column, named `COUNTRY`, that contains a uppercase version of the country names in the `"country"` column. You can use the string method [`upper()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper) for this.
- To see if your code worked, print out `cars`. Don't indent this code, so that it's not part of the `for` loop.



```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Code for loop that adds COUNTRY column



# Print cars
print(cars)
```

##  Hints 

- Start from the code example and replace `brics` with `cars`. This time you want to create a column named `"COUNTRY"`. You'll also need `row["country"].upper()`.
- To print out a variable `x`, write `print(x)` on a new line in the script. Don't indent this line!



##  Solution 

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Code for loop that adds COUNTRY column
for lab, row in cars.iterrows() :
    cars.loc[lab, "COUNTRY"] = row["country"].upper()
    
# Print cars
print(cars)
```
