#  Calculate the odds

```
Exercise ID 15696
```

##  Assignment 

The histogram of the previous exercise was created from a NumPy array `ends`, that contains 500 integers. Each integer represents the end point of a random walk. To calculate the chance that this end point is greater than or equal to 60, you can count the number of integers in `ends` that are greater than or equal to 60 and divide that number by 500, the total number of simulations.

Well then, what's the estimated chance that you'll reach at least 60 steps high if you play this Empire State Building game? The `ends` array is everything you need; it's available in your Python session so you can make calculations in the IPython Shell.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
all_walks = []
for i in range(500) :
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(100) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)
        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
        if np.random.rand() <= 0.001 :
            step = 0
        random_walk.append(step)
    all_walks.append(random_walk)
np_aw_t = np.transpose(np.array(all_walks))
ends = np_aw_t[-1,:]
```

##  Hints 

`np.mean(ends &gt;= 30)` gives you the fraction of simulations that ended greater than or equal to step 30.



##  Solution
