#  Subsetting columns

```
Exercise ID 1095616
```

##  Assignment 

When working with data, you may not need all of the variables in your dataset. Square brackets (`[]`) can be used to select only the columns that matter to you in an order that makes sense to you.
To select only `"col_a"` of the DataFrame `df`, use

```
df["col_a"]

```

To select `"col_a"` and `"col_b"` of `df`, use

```
df[["col_a", "col_b"]]

```

`homelessness` is available and `pandas` is loaded as `pd`.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import pandas as pd
homelessness = pd.read_pickle("/usr/local/share/datasets/homeless_data.pkl")
```



##  Solution 

No solution was found.
