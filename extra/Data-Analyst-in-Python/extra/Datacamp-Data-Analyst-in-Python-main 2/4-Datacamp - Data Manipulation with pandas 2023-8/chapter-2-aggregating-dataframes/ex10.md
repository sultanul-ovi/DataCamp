#  Pivoting on one variable

```
Exercise ID 1095648
```

##  Assignment 

Pivot tables are the standard way of aggregating data in spreadsheets. 

In pandas, pivot tables are essentially another way of performing grouped calculations. That is, the `.pivot_table()` method is an alternative to `.groupby()`. 

In this exercise, you'll perform calculations using `.pivot_table()` to replicate the calculations you performed in the last lesson using `.groupby()`.

`sales` is available and `pandas` is imported as `pd`.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import pandas as pd
sales = pd.read_pickle("/usr/local/share/datasets/sales_subset.pkl.bz2")
```
