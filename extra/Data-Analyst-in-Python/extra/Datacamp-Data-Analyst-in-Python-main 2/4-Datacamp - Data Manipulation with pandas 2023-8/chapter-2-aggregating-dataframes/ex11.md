#  Fill in missing values and sum values with pivot tables

```
Exercise ID 1095652
```

##  Assignment 

The `.pivot_table()` method has several useful arguments, including `fill_value` and `margins`. 

- `fill_value` replaces missing values with a real value (known as **imputation**). What to replace missing values with is a topic big enough to have its own course ([Dealing with Missing Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/dealing-with-missing-data-in-python)), but the simplest thing to do is to substitute a dummy value.
- `margins` is a shortcut for when you pivoted by two variables, but also wanted to pivot by each of those variables separately: it gives the row and column totals of the pivot table contents.

In this exercise, you'll practice using these arguments to up your pivot table skills, which will help you crunch numbers more efficiently!

`sales` is available and `pandas` is imported as `pd`.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import pandas as pd
sales = pd.read_pickle("/usr/local/share/datasets/sales_subset.pkl.bz2")
```
