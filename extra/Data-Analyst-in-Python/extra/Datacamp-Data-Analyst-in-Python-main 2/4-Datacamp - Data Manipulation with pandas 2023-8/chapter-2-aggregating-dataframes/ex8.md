#  Calculations with .groupby()

```
Exercise ID 1095643
```

##  Assignment 

The `.groupby()` method makes life much easier. In this exercise, you'll perform the same calculations as last time, except you'll use the `.groupby()` method. You'll also perform calculations on data grouped by two variables to see if sales differ by store type depending on if it's a holiday week or not. 

`sales` is available and `pandas` is loaded as `pd`.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import pandas as pd

sales = pd.read_pickle("/usr/local/share/datasets/sales_subset.pkl.bz2")
```
