#  Subsetting pivot tables

```
Exercise ID 1095667
```

##  Assignment 

A pivot table is just a DataFrame with sorted indexes, so the techniques you have learned already can be used to subset them. In particular, the `.loc[]` + slicing combination is often helpful.

`pandas` is loaded as `pd`. `temp_by_country_city_vs_year` is available.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import pandas as pd
temperatures = pd.read_pickle("/usr/local/share/datasets/temperatures_no_unc.pkl")

temperatures["year"] = temperatures["date"].dt.year
temp_by_country_city_vs_year = temperatures.pivot_table("avg_temp_c", index = ["country", "city"], columns = "year")
```



##  Instructions 

Use `.loc[]` on `temp_by_country_city_vs_year` to take subsets.

- From Egypt to India.
- From Egypt, Cairo to India, Delhi.
- From Egypt, Cairo to India, Delhi, and 2005 to 2010.



```
# Subset for Egypt to India
____

# Subset for Egypt, Cairo to India, Delhi
____

# Subset for Egypt, Cairo to India, Delhi, and 2005 to 2010
____
```

##  Hints 

- To subset rows at the outer level, use `.loc["country1":"country2"]`.
- To subset rows at the outer level, use `.loc[("country1", "city1"):("country2", "city2")]`.
- To subset in both directions, pass two arguments to `.loc[]`.



##  Solution 

```
# Subset for Egypt to India
temp_by_country_city_vs_year.loc["Egypt":"India"]

# Subset for Egypt, Cairo to India, Delhi
temp_by_country_city_vs_year.loc[("Egypt", "Cairo"):("India", "Delhi")]

# Subset for Egypt, Cairo to India, Delhi, and 2005 to 2010
temp_by_country_city_vs_year.loc[("Egypt", "Cairo"):("India", "Delhi"), "2005":"2010"]
```
