#  Calculating on a pivot table

```
Exercise ID 1095668
```

##  Assignment 

Pivot tables are filled with summary statistics, but they are only a first step to finding something insightful. Often you'll need to perform further calculations on them. A common thing to do is to find the rows or columns where the highest or lowest value occurs. 

Recall from Chapter 1 that you can easily subset a Series or DataFrame to find rows of interest using a logical condition inside of square brackets. For example: `series[series &gt; value]`.

`pandas` is loaded as `pd` and the DataFrame `temp_by_country_city_vs_year` is available.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import pandas as pd
temperatures = pd.read_pickle("/usr/local/share/datasets/temperatures_no_unc.pkl")

temperatures["year"] = temperatures["date"].dt.year
temp_by_country_city_vs_year = temperatures.pivot_table("avg_temp_c", index = ["country", "city"], columns = "year")
```



##  Instructions 

- Calculate the mean temperature for each year, assigning to `mean_temp_by_year`.
- Filter `mean_temp_by_year` for the year that had the highest mean temperature.
- Calculate the mean temperature for each city (across columns), assigning to `mean_temp_by_city`.
- Filter `mean_temp_by_city` for the city that had the lowest mean temperature.



```
# Get the worldwide mean temp by year
mean_temp_by_year = temp_by_country_city_vs_year.____

# Filter for the year that had the highest mean temp
print(mean_temp_by_year[____])

# Get the mean temp by city
mean_temp_by_city = temp_by_country_city_vs_year.____

# Filter for the city that had the lowest mean temp
print(mean_temp_by_city[____])
```

##  Hints 

- Call `.mean()` without arguments to get the mean of each column.
- Use Boolean filtering of the form `mean_temp_by_year` equal to `mean_temp_by_year.max()`.
- Call `.mean()`, setting `axis` to `"columns"` to get the mean of each row.
- Use Boolean filtering of the form `mean_temp_by_city` equal to `mean_temp_by_city.min()`.



##  Solution 

```
# Get the worldwide mean temp by year
mean_temp_by_year = temp_by_country_city_vs_year.mean()

# Filter for the year that had the highest mean temp
print(mean_temp_by_year[mean_temp_by_year == mean_temp_by_year.max()])

# Get the mean temp by city
mean_temp_by_city = temp_by_country_city_vs_year.mean(axis="columns")

# Filter for the city that had the lowest mean temp
print(mean_temp_by_city[mean_temp_by_city == mean_temp_by_city.min()])
```
