#  DataFrame to CSV

```
Exercise ID 1095692
```

##  Assignment 

You're almost there! To make things easier to read, you'll need to sort the data and export it to CSV so that your colleagues can read it.

`pandas` as `pd` has been imported for you.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
from urllib.request import urlretrieve
url = "https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5386/datasets/e0bbcc236b192efe5814c379d8c669157311acc5/airline_bumping.csv"
urlretrieve(url, "airline_bumping.csv")

import pandas as pd

airline_bumping = pd.read_csv("airline_bumping.csv")
airline_totals = airline_bumping.groupby("airline")[["airline", "nb_bumped", "total_passengers"]].sum()
airline_totals["bumps_per_10k"] = airline_totals["nb_bumped"] / airline_totals["total_passengers"] * 10000
```



##  Instructions 

- Sort `airline_totals` by the values of `bumps_per_10k` from highest to lowest, storing as `airline_totals_sorted`.
- Print your sorted DataFrame.
- Save the sorted DataFrame as a CSV called `"airline_totals_sorted.csv"`.



```
# Create airline_totals_sorted
airline_totals_sorted = ____

# Print airline_totals_sorted
____

# Save as airline_totals_sorted.csv
____
```

##  Hints 

- To sort in descending order, set `ascending` to `False`.
- Save to CSV by calling `.to_csv()`, passing the filename to save to as a string.



##  Solution 

```
# Create airline_totals_sorted
airline_totals_sorted = airline_totals.sort_values("bumps_per_10k", ascending=False)

# Print airline_totals_sorted
print(airline_totals_sorted)

# Save as airline_totals_sorted.csv
airline_totals_sorted.to_csv("airline_totals_sorted.csv")
```
