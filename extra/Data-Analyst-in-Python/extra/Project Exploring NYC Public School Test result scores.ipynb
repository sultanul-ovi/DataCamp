There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n","\n","Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n","\n","You have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n","\n","You have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT
