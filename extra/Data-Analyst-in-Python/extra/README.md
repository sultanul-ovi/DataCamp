# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains five data analysis projects completed as part of the DataCamp Data Analyst in Python track. Each project focuses on a different dataset and explores various analytical techniques to derive insights and answer specific questions. Below are the descriptions for each project.

## Projects

### 1. Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores
This project analyzes the test result scores of NYC public schools to identify trends and patterns in student performance. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to answer questions related to factors affecting student outcomes.

### 2. Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners
In this project, the Nobel Prize winner data is examined to uncover patterns in awarding trends over the years. The analysis includes identifying the most commonly awarded gender and birth country, determining the decade with the highest ratio of US-born winners, and analyzing the proportions of female laureates in different categories.

### 3. Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles
This analysis focuses on crime data from Los Angeles, exploring various aspects such as the frequency of crimes by hour and location. The project involves identifying peak crime hours, the most crime-prone areas at night, and examining the demographics of crime victims based on age groups.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches
This project conducts a statistical hypothesis test to compare the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches to those in men's matches. The analysis uses official FIFA World Cup match data and determines whether there is a significant difference in scoring between the two categories, using a 10% significance level.

### 5. Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches (Repeated)
In this project, a similar approach to the previous one is taken to explore soccer match data. The focus remains on analyzing goal-scoring patterns between men's and women's international matches, with emphasis on hypothesis testing and statistical significance.

## Conclusion
These projects demonstrate the application of data analysis techniques in Python, including exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and data visualization. The insights gained from each project can inform decisions and foster a deeper understanding of the respective topics.
