# Projects Notebook

Here, I noted down all the projects I did in datacamp platform.

## Project 0: Introduction to Notebook Projects

> Get up to speed with notebook based projects. This will prepare you for your first Python, SQL & R projects.

**Project Description:** This introductory project will take you through how to work with DataLab notebooks and how to use these to solve DataCamp projects. You will learn about notebooks and cells and how to use these to solve the problems in our Python, SQL & R projects. You'll soon be ready to tackle your first real notebook based project!

## Project 1: Analyzing Students' Mental Health

> Use your data manipulation skills to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset around student mental health.

**Project Description:** Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? One Japanese international university decided to find out! Use your data manipulation skills to explore the data from a study on the mental health of international students, and find out which factors may have the greatest impact.

## Project 2: Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales

> Derive insights about motorcycle part sales over time across multiple warehouse sites!

**Project Description:** Working on behalf of a company that sells motorcycle parts, you'll dig into their data to help them understand their revenue streams. You'll build up a query to find out how much net revenue they are generating across their product lines, segregating by date and warehouse.

## Project 3: Analyze International Debt Statistics

> Write SQL queries to answer interesting questions about international debt using data from The World Bank.

**Project Description:** In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. Use your data manipulation skills to find out which countries have the highest and lowest amounts of debt.

## Project 4: Analyzing Industry Carbon Emissions

> Use your SQL skills to explore a dataset about product carbon emissions.

**Project Description:** Product emissions make up more than 75% of global emissions. But which industries are the worst offenders? Use your SQL skills to investigate!

## Project 5: Analyzing Unicorn Companies

> Use your SQL skills to find out how many companies reached a valuation of over $1 billion across different industries between 2019 and 2021!

**Project Description:** Which industries are booming? Where should your next investment be? With the rise of the ‘amateur investor’ and the availability of platforms enabling people to invest and sell stock in public companies, it’s never been a better time to understand the financial performance of companies across the globe! Using a PostgreSQL database you’ll be able to analyze information about unicorn companies worth over $1 billion! You’ll find out which industries have the highest average valuation and then zoom in on these to determine how many new unicorns have been produced annually between 2019 and 2021!

## Project 6: Exploring Trends in American Baby Names

> Use categorization and ranking techniques to explore 101 years of American baby names.

**Project Description:** What makes a name timeless or trendy? This project uses over a century of U.S. Social Security data to explore American baby name preferences. The data manipulation skills you'll use in this project are broadly applicable: understanding changing tastes is a key competency for businesses as well as parents searching for a baby name!

## Project 7: Investigating Netflix Movies

> Apply the foundational Python skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python by manipulating and visualizing movie data.

**Project Description:** Explore Netflix movie data and perform exploratory data analysis for a production company to uncover insights about movies from a particular decade.

## Project 8: Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores

> Use data manipulation and summary statistics to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools!

**Project Description:** Every year, school test results impact the college admissions fate of millions of students. In this project, you will use standardized test performance data from NYC's public schools to identify the schools with top math results, look at how performance varies by borough, and find the city's top ten performing schools!

## Project 9: Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles

> Find out when and where crime is most likely to occur, along with the types of crimes commonly committed in LA.

**Project Description:** Los Angeles, California, attracts people from all over the world, offering lots of opportunities, not always of the good kind! In this project, you'll serve as a data detective, supporting the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in analyzing crime data to guide how they should allocate resources to protect the people of their city!
